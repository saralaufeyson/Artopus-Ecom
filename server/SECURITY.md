# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the repository owners or via email to security@example.com. Do not open public issues for security-sensitive information.

To help keep the project secure:

- Keep dependencies up to date (Dependabot is enabled).
- Run `npm audit` regularly and review audit findings.
- Use a secrets manager for production keys (do not commit secrets to the repo).
