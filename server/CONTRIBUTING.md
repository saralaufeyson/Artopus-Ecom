# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! A few quick items to get started:

- Run tests: npm test
- Run lint: npm run lint
- Use pre-commit hooks (husky) — run `npm install` so husky is installed and `npm run prepare` to enable hooks.
- To run CI locally: install Node 18 or 20 and run the test and lint commands.

If you open a pull request, CI will run lint and tests across supported Node versions.
